      <description>Reasoning has long been regarded as a cornerstone of intelligence, traditionally dominated by symbolic approaches (Russell &amp;amp; Norvig, 2016). The recent launch of o1 series by OpenAI marked the productionalization of large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems. At the core of these systems lies a key yet simple technique known as chain of thought (CoT). This blog explores the concept of chain-of-thought reasoning, tracing its origins, examining its variants, and uncovering its limitations.</description>
